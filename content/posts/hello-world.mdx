Welcome to my engineering blog! I'm excited to share my thoughts on software engineering, architecture, and team building.

## What to Expect

Here, I'll be writing about:

- **Engineering Management**: Team building, hiring, and growing engineers
- **Architecture**: Microservices, Event Sourcing, CQRS, and system design
- **Cloud Native**: Kubernetes, GCP, Terraform, and infrastructure
- **AI/ML**: Practical applications of AI in software development

## Why Blog?

Writing helps me organize my thoughts and share knowledge with the community. I hope you find something useful here!

Stay tuned for more posts.
